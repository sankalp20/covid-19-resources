                Amidst the rising number of COVID-19 cases in India,citizens are scrambling for medical oxygen and hospital beds. The situation is alarming now with people not getting beds. Many call up hospitals, while others walk into hospitals and wait till they get a bed.
            </p>
            <p>
                We as a team thought that "<em>there is a need to provide real time information to the public on the availability of the beds and oxygen as they can reach such hospitals immediately.</em>" This will avoid unnecessary waste of time for patients, which has led to late admission and, in some cases, death.
            </p>
            <p class="a1">
                NOTHING IN LIFE IS TO BE FEARED, IT IS ONLY TO BE UNDERSTOOD. NOW IS THE TIME TO UNDERSTOOD MORE, SO THAT WE MAY FEAR LESS.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we all are aware that many patients are having to wait outside hospitals for hours for beds and there is also lack in availability of medical oxygen. So, our website aims to relieve patients and their families of this harassment.
